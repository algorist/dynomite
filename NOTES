- bad things that happen when nodes share a data dir:
  - nodes after the 2nd do not join correctly on startup
  - seeming instability in get/put as nodes join/leave?

- membership init makes a gen_server call, which even if not related,
  is not legal

- lots of tests still broken

- missing tests for node joining

- data dir is not ensured before use (--data arg to start)
