Implementation of a btree based merkle tree.  The original merkle tree would not scale out to a large number of keys due to the limitation of keeping the tree in main memory.  Therefore we will try and store the 

btree file:
preamble: blocksize, rootpointer
node:{0,m:32,[keyhash:32],[childhash:32,child:64]}

leaf:{1,m:32,[keyhash:32,keypointer:64,valhash:32]}

for nodes:
blocksize = 1 + 4 + D*4 + (D+1)*12
D = (blocksize-17)/16

for leaves:
blocksize = 5 + D*16
D = (blocksize-5)/16

key file:

[key\0,key\0,key\0]
